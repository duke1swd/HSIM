# HSIM
Rocket Motor Simulator

INTRODUCTION

This is HSIM 1.0.
Based on HSIM 0.4

At present the models assume the tank is a cylinder and that the any
solid fuel grain is a cylinder (i.e. has a single port).  The assumption
of self-pressurized nitrous is pretty baked into the model, but the
other simplifying assumptions are lightly used and could probably be
changed without much difficulty.

This pre-release version of the simulator is intended for use by people
who have substantial knowledge of small hybrid or liquid motor design.

AS-IS USAGE

This simulator has been somewhat tested and appears to give reasonable
results over a useful range of inputs.  However, the authors make
no warranty of correctness or even reasonableness.
