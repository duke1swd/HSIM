This is cpropep version 1.0, a program for determining the
theoretical performance of rocket propellant compositions.
Cpropep is released under the GPL and is written in ANSI C.
It has compiled successfully under the following platforms:
   . i686 Windows 98 (4.10.1998) running Microsoft Visual 
     C++ 6.0 Standard Edition with Microsoft Visual Studio
     Service Pack 2
   . i686 Red Hat Linux 6.2 (Kernel 2.2.14-12) with gcc
   . i586 Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (Kernel 2.2.16) with gcc

To compile under linux, type make in the top-level directory.

Under MSVC++, there is no automatic makefile process yet. You
have to manually compile each of the libraries and each of the
executables by creating a project for each of them.

Run using 
    cpropep -h
for command-line help and usage.
The file cpropep.conf should contain the path of the data file 
if they are not in the current directory.
